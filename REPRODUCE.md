# Reproduction

Reproducing a previous run of dts_generation for an npm package requires:
- python, node, npm, docker, and git versions should preverably match the versions that are specified in the versions file generated by the previous run.
- `--output-path` has to point to the output of the previous run and `--reproduce` has to be set. This will ensure that the README, main, test, package.json and package-lock.json files of the previous run will be used instead of redownloading / recreating them, which is especially important for installing npm packages.
- `--remove-cache` can be set to reduce the size of the output, while keeping reproducability intact.

## LLM reproduction

Reproducing a previous run of dts_generation which also used `--simple-llm-generation` or `--advanced-llm-generation` additionally requires:
- Use the version of openai that is specified in the versions file of the previous run, and make sure that the version was a snapshot model (e.g. gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, not just gpt-4o-mini).
- Use the model and temperature that is specified in the versions file of the previous run, and make sure that the temperature was 0.
